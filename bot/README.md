## FAQs / Useful Information

**Why are multiple bot tokens added to UPLOADER_BOTS_1 and UPLOADER_BOTS_2?**

- Utilizing multiple bot tokens helps distribute the workload across various bots, significantly reducing the chances of receiving floodwait errors from Telegram's API. These errors typically occur when a bot tries to upload or download a large number of .ts files within a short period.

**Why are there two channels, STORAGE_CHANNEL_1 and STORAGE_CHANNEL_2?**

- Each Telegram channel can have a maximum of 50 admins. If you need to employ more bots to manage uploads, utilizing two channels is necessary. This setup allows you to have up to 100 bots (50 per channel) working simultaneously, enhancing efficiency and capacity.
